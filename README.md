## NeuraMemory AI

NeuraMemory AI is an intelligent system designed to augment human memory and knowledge management using advanced AI. It acts like a “second brain,” helping you save, organize, and find information easily, while understanding context, linking related ideas, and giving smart summaries and insights.

**Key Features:**

- **Full-Stack Web Application** with a user-friendly chatbot interface.
- **Secure Authentication:** Includes login and signup functionality for safe user access.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction:** Users can interact via text, links, files, and documents.
- **Memory Management:**
  - All chats are stored as memories.
  - Memories are displayed as cards on the **Manage Memory** page.
  - Users can **add, update, or delete memories** easily.
- **Conversational Memory:** Talk to your stored memories anytime.
- **Central AI Hub:** Acts as a unified interface connecting multiple AI tools and services.


## Features

- Authenticate with JWT via `httpOnly` cookies or `Authorization: Bearer` tokens.
- Enforce user-scoped authorization on all memory operations.
- Ingest memories from text, URLs, and uploaded documents.
- Parse PDF, DOCX, TXT, and Markdown documents.
- Extract `semantic` and `bubble` memory entries using LLMs.
- Generate embeddings and store vectors in Qdrant.
- Retrieve memories with `kind`, `source`, `limit`, and `offset` filters.
- Delete memories by ID or reset all user memories.
- Access OpenAPI docs via Swagger UI in non-production mode.
- Support MCP transport at `/api/v1/mcp`.
